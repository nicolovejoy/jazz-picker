Update all docs (CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP.md, anything else in docs/) with recent changes. If more than 4 markdown files, propose simplifying somehow.

Then present 3 ideas for the most useful next step, considering:

- Current priority queue in ROADMAP.md
- What would improve the gig experience most
- Quick wins vs. larger features

Keep suggestions brief with effort estimate (small/medium/large).
remove most of the "we did this" stuff unless it's relevant. succinct. germaine. not aspirational.

Remind user to update JazzPicker/Resources/BuildHistory.json if he is doing a build. propose an update statement.
