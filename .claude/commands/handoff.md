Update all docs (CLAUDE.md, HANDOFF.md, ROADMAP.md) with recent changes.

Then present 3 ideas for the most useful next step, considering:

- Current priority queue in ROADMAP.md
- What would improve the gig experience most
- Quick wins vs. larger features

Keep suggestions brief with effort estimate (small/medium/large).
remove most of the "we did this" stuff unless it's relevant. succinct. germaine. not aspirational.
