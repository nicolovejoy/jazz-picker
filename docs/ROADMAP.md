# Roadmap

## In Progress

- **iOS Groups** — Port group functionality from web. See GROUPS.md Phase 3.

## Backlog

- Setlist "now playing" indicator (see partner's current song)
- iOS: Setlist rename functionality

## Design Decisions

- **iOS primary:** Web is secondary client
- **Preferred keys:** Per-user, per-song in Firestore. Sparse storage (only non-defaults).
- **Minor keys:** Display as "F Minor" not "Fm"
