# Roadmap

## Backlog

- Rebuild catalog with MIDI note ranges (enables auto-octave)
- Firebase Auth (iOS) - Apple Sign-In ([plan](FIREBASE_AUTH_PLAN.md))
- Firebase Auth (Web) - email/password
- Setlist "now playing" indicator

---

## Working

- Browse, search, PDF viewer with edge-tap navigation
- Change Key (12-key picker), Octave +/- (±2 range)
- Auto-octave calculation (backend deployed, needs catalog rebuild)
- Setlists: CRUD, reorder, server-synced with key/octave
- Add-to-Setlist from PDF viewer (iOS + Web)
- Conflict resolution when song exists with different settings
- Offline PDF caching
