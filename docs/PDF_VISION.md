# PDF Viewing Vision

**Goal:** Immersive, distraction-free sheet music viewing.

## Requirements

1. **Full bleed** - White PDF extends edge-to-edge, no visible UI chrome
2. **No status bar** - Time/battery/wifi completely hidden
3. **Landscape mode** - Two pages side-by-side with NO gap or divider line between them, just continuous white space with music
4. **Portrait mode** - Single page, fills screen
5. **Controls auto-hide** - Appear on tap, disappear after 2 seconds

## Current Status

- Native iOS viewer hides status bar (working in build 3)
- Need to verify: seamless two-page landscape display
- Need to verify: edge-to-edge white background
